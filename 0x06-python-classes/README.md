		0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

In this project, I started practicing object-oriented programming using classes and objects in Python. I gained knowledge about attributes, methods, and properties, as well as concepts such as data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.

Project Tasks:

My first square
File: 0-square.py
Description: Defines a Python class called "Square" that represents a square.

Square with size
File: 1-square.py
Description: Builds upon 0-square.py and adds a private instance attribute called "size" to the Square class. It also allows instantiation of Square objects with a specified size.

Size validation
File: 2-square.py
Description: Builds upon 1-square.py and adds additional validation to the size attribute. If the provided size is not an integer or is less than 0, appropriate exceptions (TypeError or ValueError) are raised.

Area of a square
File: 3-square.py
Description: Builds upon 2-square.py and adds a public instance method called "area" that calculates and returns the current area of the square.

Access and update private attribute
File: 4-square.py
Description: Builds upon 3-square.py and introduces properties to access and update the private instance attribute "size" of the Square class.

Printing a square
File: 5-square.py
Description: Builds upon 4-square.py and adds a public instance method called "my_print" that prints a square using the "#" character. If the size is 0, it prints an empty line.

Coordinates of a square
File: 6-square.py
Description: Builds upon 5-square.py and introduces a private instance attribute called "position" to represent the position of the square. It also adds properties to access and update the position attribute.

Singly linked list
File: 100-singly_linked_list.py
Description: Defines two Python classes, "Node" and "SinglyLinkedList," to implement a singly-linked list. The Node class represents a node in the list, and the SinglyLinkedList class represents the list itself. Various methods and properties are provided for data manipulation and insertion.

Print Square instance
File: 101-square.py
Description: Builds upon 6-square.py and overrides the "str" method to define the string representation of a Square instance. The string representation is equivalent to the output of the "my_print" method.

Compare 2 squares
File: 102-square.py
Description: Builds upon 101-square.py and implements comparison methods "eq", "ne", "lt", "le", "gt", and "ge" to enable logical comparisons between Square instances based on their areas.

ByteCode -> Python #5
File: 103-magic_class.py
Description: Defines a Python function that matches a provided bytecode exactly.
